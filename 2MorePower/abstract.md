# More Power to the Apps!

## Abstract
In this session we will cover the new Ai Builder feature in PowerApps using Form processing. The nice auditing feature of Approvals in Power Automate (prev. Microsoft Flow). As well as, a few common use cases of Row-Level-Security and rendering a map inside your app for IOT devices. These features are intended to take your PowerApps and Power Automate skills to the next level.

## Agenda
1.	Forms - Ai builder
2.	Row-Level-Security (RLS)
3.	Approvals (with SQL Server on-premise, instead of the CDS).
4.	International Space Station (Web HTTP API)

Btw, this all demos. I look forward to seeing you there!
